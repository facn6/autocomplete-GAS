GAS Autocomplete website - https://autocompletegas.herokuapp.com/

The purpose of the website is to improve our node.js skills by making an autocomplete searchbar!

Our website has a Search Bar/Search Engine for ENG words! it autocompletes your search input (pretty much like Google :))
It shows in a display menu the words that you might be searching for!

We are a team of 3 members.
At first we had to choose the design and the files structure, we went for simple design (title, icon and a search bar),
then we split the work in a way where everyone worked in more than one thing - each member had a part in the front and back-end file!
