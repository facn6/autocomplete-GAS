#GAS Autocomplete website

https://autocompletegas.herokuapp.com/

## Why
The purpose of the website is to improve our node.js skills by making an autocomplete searchbar!

## What
Our website has a Search Bar/Search Engine for English words! it autocompletes your search input (pretty much like Google :))
It shows in a display menu the words that you might be searching for!

## How
We are a team of 3 members: Ghassan, Sam and Ahdab
At first we had to choose the design and the files structure, we went for simple design (title, icon and a search bar),
then we split the work in a way where everyone worked in more than one thing - each member had a part in the front and back-end file!

## Lessons
We have learnt about:
- Building a server and dividing our app into a front end and back end.
- Handling url requests and sending data back to the client
- Testing our app for using pure functions
- Creating dictionaries and optimising search functionality
    - Creating objects dynamically to provide a reference to help optimise the search
